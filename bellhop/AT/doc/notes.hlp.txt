
\KRAKEN\ is a normal mode program for range-varying environments in
either cartesian (line sources) or cylindrical coordinates (point
sources).  The basic method is described in 

   Porter, Michael B. and Reiss, Edward L., "A numerical method for
   ocean-acoustic normal modes", JASA 76, 244--252 (1984). 

   Porter, Michael B. and Reiss, Edward L., "A numerical method for
   bottom interacting ocean acoustic normal modes", JASA
   77, 1760--1767 (1985). 

Range-dependent solutions are obtained by using optionally
adiabatic or coupled mode theory.

There are generally no limits on the dimensions that can be handled (up
to virtual memory. The code uses dynamic allocation for virtually all
arrays. There are a few exceptions. You will generally get a flag if
for some reason any dynamic memory allocation fails or if you
have exceeded an intrinsic limit in the code.

As a consequence of the dynamic memory allocation you can go to ridiculously
large numbers of sources, receivers, modes, etc. as suits your fancy (and/or
possibly, patience).

The following modules are part of the package.


\begin{verbatim}

GROUP I: MODE COMPUTATIONS:


  KRAKEN    Solves for the modes and writes them to disk.
            Elastic media are allowed but material attenuation
            in an elastic medium is ignored.

  KRAKENC   A version of KRAKEN which finds the eigenvalues in the
            complex plane.  KRAKEN uses perturbation theory to
            obtain imaginary parts of the eigenvalues while KRAKENC
            computes the complex eigenvalues exactly. 

            KRAKENC runs about 3 times slower but is necessary for
            leaky mode computations or for including material
            attenuation in elastic media.  Internally KRAKENC replaces
            elastic layers by an equivalent reflection coefficent.
            For this reason, you cannot use KRAKENC to look at
            fields within the elastic layers.

  KRAKEL    Analogous to KRAKENC but also computes elastic
            displacements and stresses for elastic media.
            KRAKEL is seldom used and tends to not be kept
            up-to-date.

GROUP II: BASIC PLOTTING ROUTINES:


  PLOTSSP   Plots the sound speed profile.

  PLOTMODE  Plots selected modes.

  PLOTGRN   Plots the Green's funtion for the depth separated wave
            equation for a particular source/receiver combination. 

  PLOTTRI   Plots the triangular elements used for 3-D field
            calculations. 


GROUP III: FIELD COMPUTATIONS:


  FIELD     Computes fields on a vertical array over a specified
            range and for a series of source depths. Individual
            phones in the array may be displaced from the
            vertical. Range dependence is handled by either
            adiabatic or one-way coupled mode theory. 

  FIELD3D   Computes field for a three-dimensionally varying SSP
            using adiabatic mode theory. 



GROUP IV: PLOTTING ROUTINES THAT USE GROUP III PROGRAM OUTPUT:


  PLOTSHD      Plots tranmission loss in plan or elevation, i.e.
               an (x,y) plot or an (r,z) plot.
    
  PLOTRAYXY    Plots the ray paths of the Gaussian beams
               generated during 3D field calculations.
 
The various programs for computing fields (GROUP III) are only
needed for PLOTSHD, or for special user programs (e.g.
ambiguity surfaces).

The following extensions are used with these programs:

  .F90        The Fortran90/95 source code
  .HLP        A HeLP file documenting the module
  .BAT        A BATch file which runs the module

All user input in all modules is read using list-directed I/O.
Thus data can be typed in free-format using space, tabs, commas
or slashes as delimeters. Character input should be enclosed in
single quotes like this: 'CHARACTER INPUT'.

You will see the '/' character in a number of the input files.
This terminates an input line causing the program to use
default values.

                 ***** INSTALLATION NOTES *****

There is a command file for each of the programs in this package
which assigns necessary input files to the appropriate Fortran
unit number used by that program.  To simplify the installation,
these command files make use of logical names for certain directories.

The following symbols and logical names for directories are used with
the KRAKEN command files:

   AT:    This is the Acoustics Toolbox directory which contains
          command files for running KRAKEN and other models
          in the toolbox.

   KRAK:  The KRAKEN source code

   MISC:  Miscellaneous scientific subroutines, e.g.
          root-finders, linear equation solvers, ... 

   GLOB:  Global routines, that is, routines which operate on
          shade files.  These routines operate on the output of
          a number of different propagation codes including
          KRAKEN, FSTFLD, BELLHOP, SCOOTER and SPARC.

                  ***** HOW TO RUN KRAKEN *****


  0. Starting out for the first time? If the distribution does not have
     precompiled executables for your hardware, run the 'makefiles'
     to compile and link of the whole package.
     
  1. Create the environmental file for your problem, following the
     directions in KRAKEN.HLP.

  2. Run KRAKEN (or KRAKENC) by typing

     KRAKEN filename

     where "filename" is the environmental file. (The process is the same under DOS or Linux.)
     The KRAKEN.HLP file details the differences between the KRAKEN and KRAKENC.

  3. Run FIELD to sum the modes and compute the complex pressure field:
     FIELD filename

  4. You now have several choices (all the GROUP II programs). These are run from inside MATLAB:

     a. PLOTMODE to plot the modes.

     b. PLOTSSP  to plot the sound speed profile.

     c. PLOTSHD  to plot the pressure field as a function of range and depth.


     Once the modes are created by KRAKEN or KRAKENC you can run
     the above plot programs in any sequence or as often as you
     like.
