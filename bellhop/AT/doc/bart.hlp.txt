
BART uses the Bartlett estimator to produce
an ambiguity surface. Required input is a covariance matrix
and a set of replica vectors.  The replica vectors
are provided in the form of a 'SHD' file and the ambiguity
surface is written in that same format.

\begin{verbatim}

Files:

        Name           Unit         Description
Input
        *.SHD           20       SHaDe      file
        *.COV           21       COVariance file


Output
        *B.SHD          25       SHaDe file for ambiguity surface
