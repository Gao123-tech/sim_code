
The FIELD program uses the modes calculated by \KRAKEN\ 
and produces a shade file which contains a sequence of
snapshots of the acoustic field as a function of range and depth. 
A snapshot is produced for every source depth specified by the
user.

 (1) - TITLE

       Syntax:
          TITLE
       Description:
          TITLE: Title to be written to the shade file.
                 If you type a /, the title is taken from the
                 first mode file.

 (2) - OPTIONS

       Syntax:
          OPTION
       Description:
          OPTION(1:1): Source type.
                       'R' point source
                           (cylindrical (R-Z) coordinates)
                       'X' line  source
                           (cartesian   (X-Z) coordinates)
          OPTION(2:2): Selects coupled or adiabatic mode theory.
                       'C' Coupled mode theory.
                       'A' Adiabatic mode theory (default).
          OPTION(4:4): Selects coherent or incoherent mode addition
                       'C' Coherent
                       'I' Incoherent 

          For a coupled mode run you ***must*** be sure that the
          modes are finely sampled throughout the media
          (excluding the halfspaces if present) so that FIELD can accurately
          calculate the coupling integrals. This is done by using
          a large number of receiver depths (NRD) when you
          do the KRAKEN run. This number should be set to
          give about 10 points/wavelength.


 (3) - NUMBER OF MODES
       Syntax:
          M
       Description:
          M:    Number of modes to use in the field computation.
                If the number of modes specified exceeds the
                number computed then the program uses all the
                computed modes. 


 (4) - PROFILE RANGES

       Syntax:
          NPROF  RPROF(1:NPROF)
       Description:
          NPROF:   The number of profiles, i.e. ranges where a new
                   set of modes is to be used. 
          RPROF(): Ranges (km) of each of these profiles.
                   For a range independent problem there is only
                   one profile and its range is arbitrary. 
                   mode files must exist for each range of a
                   new profile and be assigned in sequence to
                   units 30,31,... The modes for the last SSP
                   profile are extended in a range-independent
                   fashion to infinity so that RMAX can exceed
                   RPROF(NPROF).
                   *** NOTE: RPROF( 1 ) must be 0.0 ***



 (6) - SOURCE/RECEIVER LOCATIONS

       Syntax:
          NR
          R(1:NR)
          NSD
          SD(1:NSD)
          NRD
          RD(1:NRD)
          NRR
          RR(1:NRR)

       Description:
          NR:   Number of receiver ranges.
          R():  The receiver ranges (km)
          NSD:  The number of source depths.
          SD(): The source depths (m).
          NRD:  The number of receiver depths.
          RD(): The receiver depths (m).
          NRR:  The number of receiver range-displacements.
                Must equal NRD. (YES, IT IS REDUNDANT)
          RR(): The receiver displacements (m).
                This vector should be all zeros for a perfectly
                vertical array.

                The  field is computed by stepping through the
                ranges, R(1:NR), and adding in the range
                displacements, RR() before computing the field
                on the array. Nonzero values are used to tilt or
                distort the receiving array, thereby simulating the
                distortion which occurs on an array deployed in
                the ocean.


       The format of the source/rcvr info is an integer
       indicating the number of sources (receivers) followed by
       real numbers indicating the depth (range) of each
       receiver.  Since this data is read in using list-directed
       I/O you can type it just about any way you want, e.g. on
       one line or split onto several lines.  Also if your depths
       are equally spaced then you can type just the first and
       last depths followed by a '/' and the intermediate depths
       will be generated automatically.
