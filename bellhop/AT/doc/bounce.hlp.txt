
BOUNCE computes the reflection coefficient for a stack of acoustic
media optionally overlying elastic media. The reflection coefficient
is written to both a '.IRC' file (internal reflection coefficient) and to a
'.BRC' file (bottom reflection coefficient).  These files can be used
by KRAKENC to provide a boundary condition or plotted using PLOTRTH.

The input structure is identical to that used by KRAKENC although
the input lines for source and receiver depth are not read
and can be omitted.  Furthermore, the surface boundary condition is
ignored and, in effect, replaced by a homogeneous halfspace where
the incident wave propagates.

If you are interested in getting a reflection coefficient for a
bottom which is being used in a KRAKENC run, you will need to delete the
layers corresponding to the water column.  Otherwise you will get a
reflection coefficient corresponding to a wave incident from above the
ocean surface.

The angles used for calculating the reflection coefficient are calculated
based on the phase-velocity interval [CMIN, CMAX].  For a full 90 degree
calculation set CMIN to the lowest speed in the problem (say 1400.0)
CMAX to 1.0E9.  The actual number of tabulated points is determined by
RMAX.

I suggest you pick RMAX equal to 10 km, interrupt BOUNCE after about 5 seconds
and look at NKPTS which is displayed in the print file.  You can then
increase or decrease RMAX to obtain adequate sampling of the reflection
loss curve (200 points is probably sufficient).

The above example (taken from the SAFARI reference manual) involves two
elastic layers.
