
The FIELDS program uses the Green's functions calculated by SCOOTER or
SPARC and produces a shade file that contains a sequence of
snapshots of the acoustic field as a function of range and depth.
Alternatively, if a single source/receiver combination is specified then
FIELDS produces a plot directly of the Green's function and transmission
loss.

 (1) - OPTIONS

      Syntax:
         OPT
      Description:
         OPT(1:1): Coordinates
                  'R' Cylindrical (R-Z) coordinates.
                  'X' Cartesian   (X-Z) coordinates.
         OPT(2:2): Spectrum
                   'P' Positive (recommended)
                   'N' Negative
                   'B' Both positive and negative
                   The spectral integral should formally be done
                   from all along the real k-axis, however the
                   negative portion contributes significantly
                   only in the near-field.  Run-time is less
                   if it is neglected.
         OPT(3:3): Interpolation type
                  'O' POlynomial (for broadband runs) (default)
                  'A' PAde       (can produce better results for CW runs but is less reliable)


 (2) - RECEIVER RANGES

       Syntax: RMIN  RMAX  NR

       Description:
          RMIN: First receiver range (km)
          RD:   Last  receiver range (km)
          NR:   Minimum number of receiver ranges
                The actual number of ranges used is increased
                slightly to satisfy FFT sampling requirements.

Note: The Pade option (OPT(3:3)) is less robust. Use polynomial interpolation if an underflow/overflow occurs ...
