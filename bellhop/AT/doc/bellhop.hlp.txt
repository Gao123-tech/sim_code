
\BELLHOP\ computes acoustic fields in oceanic
environments via beam tracing. The environment treated
consists of an acoustic medium with a sound speed that may depend on
range and depth. (However, the present version requires the user write a subroutine
to supply the sound speed in cases where the profile is both range and depth dependent.)

A theoretical description may be found in:

computing ocean acoustic fields,'' J. Acoust. Soc. Amer.

The following programs are used with \BELLHOP :

BELLHOP     Main program for doing Gaussian beam tracing

PLOTRAY     Produces plots of central rays of beams

ANGLES      Given the source and reciever sound speeds, computes
              the angle of the limiting ray.

PLOTSSP     Plots the sound speed profile


\BELLHOP\ produces pressure fields in the NRL standard format and can
therefore be plotted using the MATLAB script, plotshd.m.


\begin{verbatim}

The steps in running the program are as follows:

   1. Set up your environmental file and run PLOTSSP to make sure
      the SSP looks reasonable.

   2. Do a ray trace.  That is, 

      A. Run BELLHOP with the ray trace option to calculate about 50
      rays.

      B. Run PLOTRAY to make sure you have the angular coverage you
      expect.  Do the rays behave irregularly? If so reduce the
      step-size and try again.

   3. Re-run BELLHOP using the coherent, incoherent or semicoherent
      option for transmission loss. (Use the default number
      of beams.)

   4. Run plotshd.m to plot a full range-depth field plot.

   5. Double the number of beams and check convergence.

       Syntax: TITLE

       Description:
          TITLE: Title of run enclosed in sinqle quotes

 (2) - FREQUENCY

       Syntax: FREQ

       Description:
          FREQ: Frequency in Hz


 (3) - NUMBER OF MEDIA

       Syntax: NMEDIA (<20)

       Description:
          Dummy parameter for compatibility with KRAKEN.

 (4) - OPTIONS

       Syntax: OPTION

       Description:
          OPTION(1:1): Type of interpolation to be used for the SSP
                       'S' for cubic Spline
                       'C' for C-linear (recommended)
                       'N' for N2-linear
                       'A' for Analytic.  The user must modify the
                           analytic formulas in ANALYT.FOR and re-link. 

                       Use PLOTSSP to check that
                       the SSP looks the way you thought it should.
                       Apart from potential typos, this will also
                       show up fit-problems which might occur with
                       the spline option.  Splines yield a
                       poor fit to certain kinds of curves, e.g.
                       curves with sharp bends.
                       Splines were previously recommended because the code did
                       not have a careful treatment of discontinuities in
                       the derivative of the SSP. The latest version does.

          OPTION(2:2): Type of top boundary condition
                       'V' VACUUM above top
                       'A' ACOUSTO-ELASTIC half-space.
                           Requires another line as described in block (4a).

                           (tip: you can use the program BOUNCE to calculate a reflection
                           coefficient for a multilayered medium.)
 
                        For open ocean problems option 'V' should
                        usually be used for the surface BC.

          OPTION(3:3): Attenuation option
                   'N' Nepers/m.
                   'F' dB/(kmHz)       (F as in Frequency dependent)
                   'M' dB/m            (M as in per Meter)
                   'W' dB/wavelength   (W as in per Wavelength)
                   'Q' quality factor.

          OPTION(4:4): Added volume attenuation
                   'T' Thorp attenuation formula.

          OPTION(5:5): '*' read in a *.ati file containing the
                       top altimetry in range/depth pairs. The ranges are given in
                       km and depths in meters. The first line specifies the number of
                       pairs following.


(4a) - TOP HALFSPACE PROPERTIES

      Syntax:
         ZT  CPT  CST  RHOT  APT  AST
      Description:
         ZT:   Depth (m).
         CPT:  Top P-wave speed (m/s).
         CST:  Top S-wave speed (m/s).

         AST:  Top S-wave attenuation. (  "   "    "    "   "   ")

         This line should only be included if OPT(2:2)='A', i.e.
         if the user has specified a homogeneous halfspace for
         the top BC.


(4b) - TOP REFLECTION COEFFICIENT

      Syntax: 
         NTHETA
         THETA(1)       RMAG(1)       RPHASE(1)
         THETA(2)       RMAG(2)       RPHASE(2)
           .
           .
           .
         THETA(NTHETA)  RMAG(NTHETA)  RPHASE(NTHETA)

      Description:
         NTHETA:   Number of angles.
         THETA():  Angle.
         RMAG():   Magnitude of reflection coefficient.
         RPHASE(): Phase of reflection coefficient (degrees).

      Example:
         3
         0.0   1.00  180.0
         45.0  0.95  175.0
         90.0  0.90  170.0

      These lines should be contained in a separate '.TRC' file.
      This file is only required if OPT(2:2)='F', i.e. if the
      user has specified that the top BC is read from a '.TRC'
      (Top Reflection Coefficient) file. 


 (5) - SOUND SPEED PROFILE

       Syntax:
          NMESH  SIGMA  Z(NSSP)
          Z(1)     CP(1) /
          Z(2)     CP(2) /
          .
          .
          .
          Z(NSSP)  CP(NSSP) /

       Description:

          NMESH:   Dummy parameter for KRAKEN compatibility
          SIGMA:   Dummy parameter for KRAKEN compatibility
          Z(NSSP): Depth at bottom of medium (m).
                   This value is used to detect the last
                   SSP point when reading in the
                   profile which follows. 

                 The following should be omitted when the 'A' option
                 is used (indicating that an analytic profile is
                 supplied by a user written subroutine). 
  
          Z():   Depth (m).  Note that the surface starts at the first
                 depth point specified. Thus if you have say, XBT
                 data which starts at 50 m below the surface, then
                 you'll need to put in some SSP point at 0 m,
                 otherwise the free-surface would be placed at 50 m
                 giving erroneous results. Try to keep the number of
                 depth points to the minimum necessary to describe the
                 physics: a fine SSP sampling can force a fine step-size
                 for integrating the rays.
          CP():  P-wave speed (m/s) (Must be followed by a '/'
                 for compatibility with the KRAKEN program.)

 (6) - OPTIONS

       Syntax: OPTION  SIGMA

       Description:
          OPTION(1:1): Type of bottom boundary condition

                       'R' Perfectly RIGID
                       'A' Acoustic halfspace
                           Note that shear is not implemented; however,
                           the input format allows it to be specified
                           for compatibility with KRAKEN.
                       'F' Reflection coefficient from a FILE.
                           Requires a Bottom Reflection Coefficient file with
                           extension '.BRC'.  The format is the same as
                           that used for a Top Reflection coefficient.
                           (tip: you can use the program BOUNCE to calculate a reflection
                           coefficient for a multilayered medium.)
          OPTION(2:2): '*' read in a *.bty file containing the
                       bottom bathymetry in range/depth pairs. The ranges are given in
                       km and depths in meters. The first line specifies the number of
                       pairs following.

          SIGMA:        Bottom roughness (currently ignored)


 (7) - SOURCE/RECEIVER DEPTHS AND RANGES

       Syntax:
          NSD
          SD(1:NSD)
          NRD
          RD(1:NRD)
          NR

       Description:
          NSD:  The number of source depthS
          SD(): The source depths (m)
          NRD:  The number of receiver depths
          RD(): The receiver depths (m)
          NR:   The number of receiver ranges
          R():  The receiver ranges (km)

       This data is read in using list-directed I/O you can type it
       just about any way you want, e.g. on one line or split onto
       several lines.  Also if the depths or ranges are equally spaced
       then you can type just the first and last depths followed by a
       '/' and the intermediate depths will be generated automatically. 


 (8) - RUN TYPE

       Syntax:
          OPTION

       Description:
          OPTION(1:1): 'R' generates a ray file
                       'E' generates an eigenray file
                       'A' generates an amplitude-delay file (ascii)
                       'a' generate  an amplitude-delay file (binary)
                       'C' Coherent     TL calculation
                       'I  Incoherent   TL calculation
                       'S' Semicoherent TL calculation
                            (Lloyd mirror source pattern)

          OPTION(2:2): 'G' Geometric beams (default)
                       'B' Gaussian  beams

          OPTION(3:3): '*' read in a source beam pattern file (sbpfil)
                       ' ' don't (default)

          OPTION(4:4): 'R' point source (cylindrical coordinates) (default)
                       'X' line  source (cartesian coordinates)
                       

       The ray file and eigenray files have the same simple
       ascii format and can be plotted using the fortran code,

       The ray file and eigenray files have the same simple
       ascii format and can be plotted using the fortran code,
       plotray.f, or the Matlab script plotray.m. 

       The amplitude-delay file can be used with the Matlab script
       stackarr.m to 'stack the arrivals', i.e. to convolve them
       with the source spectrum and plot the channel response. stackarr.m
       can also be used to simple plot the impulse response.

       For TL calculations, the output is in the shdfil format used
       by all the codes in the Acoustics Toolbox and can be plotted
       using the Matlab script, plotshd.m. (Use toasc.f to convert
       the binary shade files to ascii format for use by plotshd.m
       or whatever plot package you're using.)

       There are actually several different types of Gaussian beam options
       (OPTION(2:2)) implemented in the code. Only the two described above
       are fully maintained.

       The source beam pattern file has the format

       NSBPPts
       angle1  amp1
       angle2  amp2
        ...

       with angle in degrees and amplitude in dB.

 (9) - BEAM FAN

       Syntax:
          NBEAMS
          ALPHA(1:NBEAMS)

       Description:
          NBEAMS: Number of beams (use 0 to have the program
                  calculate a value automatically, but conservatively).
          ALPHA(): Beam angles (negative angles toward surface)

       For a ray trace you can type in a sequence of angles
       or you can type the first and last angles followed by a
       '/'.  For a TL calculation, the rays must be equally spaced
       otherwise the results will be incorrect.


 (10) - NUMERICAL INTEGRATOR INFO

       Syntax:
          STEP  ZBOX  RBOX

       Description:
          STEP:  The step size used for tracing the rays (m).
          ZBOX:  The maximum depth to trace a ray        (m).
          RBOX:  The maximum range to trace a ray       (km).

       The required step size depends on many factors.  This includes
       frequency, size of features in the SSP (such as surface
       ducts), range of rcvrs, and whether a coherent or incoherent
       TL calculation is performed.  If you use STEP=0.0 BELLHOP will
       use a default step-size and tell you what it picked.  You should
       then halve the step size until the results are convergent to
       your required accuracy.  To obtain a smooth ray trace you should
       use the spline SSP interpolation and a step-size less than the
       smallest distance between SSP data points.

       Rays are traced until they exit the box ( ZBOX, RBOX ).  By
       setting ZBOX less than the water depth you can eliminate
       bottom reflections. Make ZBOX, RBOX a bit (say 1%) roomy
       too make sure rays are not killed the moment they hit the
       bottom or are just reaching your furthest receiver.
