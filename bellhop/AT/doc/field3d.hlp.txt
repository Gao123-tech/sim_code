
The FIELD3D program uses the modes calculated by \KRAKEN\ 
and produces a shade file which contains a sequence
of 2-D slices of the acoustic field.  It is commonly used
to compute a field in plan view, i.e. as a function of
horizontal coordinates (x,y). It can also be used to compute
the field on a vertical slice along any fixed bearing through
the 3-D environment.

FIELD3D uses a tiling of the ocean environment based on triangles.
The terminology is taken from finite-elements.  To define the
triangles you must do the following:

(1) Lay out a grid of points (nodes) where you will construct
environmental files for \KRAKEN\ and solve for the modes.  A coarse
rule-of-thumb is to pick points every 10 km but obviously a coarser
spacing can be used in sites with less environmental change.

(2) Assign a number to each of the nodes.

(3) Form a triangulation of the nodes.  That is,
connect the nodes with lines such that the grid is divided into
a number of triangles.  This should be done with an eye towards
keeping the area of the individual triangles uniform.  All nodes
should be a corner of at least one triangle. Each triangle is
referred to as an element.

There are algorithms for performing this step automatically and if
you write one I would be glad to receive it.  If instead you do
this by hand you will rapidly discover the merits of using a regular
grid.

(4) Assign a number to each of the elements.

You now have the information required by FIELD3D to describe your
triangulation.  In the input file you first tell FIELD3D the
coordinates of each node and the name of the file containing the
modes at each node.  You then tell FIELD3D how you connected the
nodes to form a triangulation.  This is done by specifying the node
numbers which define the corners of each successive element
(triangle).

(1) - OPTIONS

      Syntax:
         OPT
      Description:
         OPT(3:3): Type of caculation.
                   'STD' (Standard) for an Nx2D run.
                   'GBT' (Gaussian beam trace) for a 3D run.
                   'PDQ' For a fast preview run.
                   The 'STD' option neglects horizontal
                   refraction but runs a lot faster.
                   Avoid using the 'GBT' option:
                   it requires some care to use
                   properly. Option 'PDQ' runs about 3x as fast
                   as 'STD' but is less accurate.
         OPT(4:4): TESCHECK (tesselation check) flag.
                   'T'  Perform the tesselation check.
                   'F'  omit    the tesselation check.
                   For all but the simplest setups the user will
                   INVARIABLY make an error in setting up the
                   triangulation.  The first step to avoid this
                   is to run PLOTTRI to get a plot of the
                   triangulation.  Even after that one should
                   invoke this 'TESCHECK' option however for
                   large problems some time can be saved by
                   turning off this feature after the
                   triangulation has been checked once.
         OPT(5:5): Type of beams.
                   There are several types of Gaussian beams
                   available.  I suggest using 'M'. This option
                   is ignored unless the Gaussian beam
                   calculation has been selected. 
         OPT(6:6): Ray file flag.
                   Use 'R' to have a file of ray path
                   trajectories (in the horizontal plane) written
                   to disk for subsequent plotting using the
                   PLOTRAYXY program.  These rays show the
                   horizontal refraction of individual modes.
                   This option is ignored if you select a 'STD'
                   or 'PDQ' run for then the ray paths are just
                   straight lines.


(2) - NUMBER OF MODES

      Syntax:
         M
      Description:
         M:    Number of modes to use in the field computation.
               If the number of modes specified exceeds the
               number computed then the program uses all the
               computed modes. 


(3) - SOURCE COORDINATES
 
      Syntax:
         XS  YS
      Description:
         XS:  X-coordinate of source (km).
         YS:  Y-coordinate of source (km).


(4) - SOURCE/RECEIVER DEPTHS

      Syntax:
         NSD
         SD(1:NSD)
         NRD
         RD(1:NRD)
      Description:
         NSD:  The number of source depths. (<3)
         SD(): The source   depths (m).
         NRD:  The number of receiver depths.
               (<51 and NR*NRD < 54000)
         RD(): The receiver depths (m).


(5) - RECEIVER RANGES

      Syntax:
         NR
         RMIN  RMAX
      Description:
         NR:   Number of receiver ranges.
               (NR<4094 and NR * NRD <= 210000)
         RMIN: First receiver range (km). MUST BE ZERO!
         RMAX: Last  receiver range (km).
        

(6) - RADIALS

      Syntax:
         NTHETA
         THETA(1:NTHETA)
      Description:
         NTHETA:  Number of radials. (<101)
         THETA(): Angles for each radial (degrees).
          
      For full circle (or disc) coverage our plotting program
      likes to have a repeated radial, say 0 and 360 degrees.

      You cannot have multiple sources, receivers and bearings
      in a single run: at least one of NSD, NRD or NTHETA must
      be 1.


(7) - NODES

      Syntax:
         NNODES
         X(1)       Y(1)       FILNAM(1)
         X(2)       Y(2)       FILNAM(2)
          .
          .
          .
         X(NNODES)  Y(NNODES)  FILNAM(NNODES)
      Description:
         NNODES:    Number of nodes. (<1000).
         X():       X-coordinate of node (km).
         Y():       Y-coordinate of node (km). 
         FILNAM():  Name of the mode file for that node.
                    Use the name 'DUMMY' to produce an acoustic
                    absorber.

(8) - ELEMENTS

      Syntax:
         NELTS
         NODE1(1)       NODE2(1)       NODE3(1)
         NODE1(2)       NODE2(2)       NODE3(2)
          .
          .
          .
         NODE1(NELTS)  NODE2(NELTS)  NODE3(NELTS)
      Description:
         NELTS:    Number of elements. (<1500)
         NODE1():  Number of node at first corner of the triangle.
         NODE2():     "   "   "    " second   "   "    "    "
         NODE3():     "   "   "    " third    "   "    "    "

         In this fashion we define a tiling of triangular
         elements. The ordering of the elements is arbitrary.


(9) - GAUSSIAN BEAM INFO

      Syntax:
         ALPHA1  ALPHA2  NALPHA
         STEP  NSTEPS
         EPMULT
      Description:
         ALPHA1: First angle for beam fan (degrees).
         ALPHA2: Last    "    "    "   "     "
         NALPHA: Number of beams in fan.
         STEP:   Step size (m).
         NSTEPS: Number of steps.
         EPMULT: Epsilon multipler for beam initial conditions.

      This Gaussian beam info can be omitted if the 'STD' option
      in block (1) is used.

---------------------------------------------------------------

To get a rough idea of run time, consider a 50 Hz deep water problem
with 60 modes (waterborne modes only) and for 37 radials with 501
range points per radial.  On a 1 megaflop workstation, this required
about 3 minutes with option 'STD' and 6 hours when including horizontal
refraction via option 'GBT'. 

Run time is roughly proportional to M * NTHETA * NR.
