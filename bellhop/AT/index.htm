<h1><font face="Arial">Which version should I download?</font></h1>
<ul style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 9">
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 18"><font face="Arial"><b>atWinPII_f95</b>. This is the latest and greatest version. The
    'WinPII' in
    the name signifies that I have also pre-compiled it for a Windows, Pentium II
    machine. The executables in at\bin should work under Windows (various
    versions) on Pentium II machines. They don't seem to work under Linux. If
    you're using another machine or operating systems you'll need to recompile
    it which requires a Fortran95 compiler. (Fortran 90 and 95 are almost
    identical so you should be able to get it to work under f90.) The Makefiles
    are in a sort of Unix style. If you download cygwin (publicly available on
    the web) you get a sort of pseudo-Unix window in which you can just type
    'make all' and 'make install' to recompile and install.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 18"><font face="Arial"><b>atLinuxPII_f95</b>. Same
    as above but with binaries compiled under Linux.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 18"><font face="Arial"><b>BellhopRD</b> This is a version modified by Giancarlo Dreini (formerly
    of SACLANTCEN) to allow for range-dependence in the sound speed profile. If
    you really need that feature this is the only currently available version,
    however, it is not current with atpII_f95 and it is sparsely commented.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 18"><font face="Arial"><b>at_Unix.tar.Z</b>. This is an old Unix f77 version. It's made available
    here primarily since it has a set of cshell scripts for running the code
    under Unix.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 18"><font face="Arial"><b>atpII_f77old</b>. This is an old PC f77 version, provided for those
    that do not have access to a Fortran90/95 compiler. However, there are many
    improvements in the f95 version.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 18"><font face="Arial"><b>atvaxold</b>. This is an old VAX version going back to about 1991.
    Compilation and run scripts may be useful to anyone still using VAX
    computers, otherwise not recommended.</font></li>
